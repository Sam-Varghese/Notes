<h1 align="center">BootStrap</h1>

<hr>

- In order to include BootStrap in our code, put this link:

<hr>

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>`

<hr>

- Firstly after all html skeleton tags, enclose all the rest of the contents inside `div` of class `.container-fluid`

<hr>

# Responsive Images

<hr>

- Just add `img-responsive` class to the img tag in order to make images responsive.

<hr>

# Centered Headings

<hr>

- In order to center the headings, we apply following class to the heading tag: `text-center`

<hr>

# Button

<hr>

- Add following classes to button, in order to beautify them: `btn` & `btn-default` ie `btn btn-default`.

<hr>

- We can make button element a block element by adding the following class `btn-block`. Still remember that `btn`class is necessary.

<hr>

## Call out Optional Actions with btn-info

<hr>

- Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The `btn-info` class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

<hr>

## Danger Button

<hr>

- In order to alert users of a button that performs a dangerous task, we use `btn-danger` class along with `btn`  and `btn-block`.

<hr>

# Grid Layout

<hr>

- We can align element in different columns using BootStrap.
- For this BootStrap has by default 12 column already there.
- Suppose if we are aiming to make element appear in column for laptops, then we use `col-md-*` where `md` means medium and * means number specifying with of element.
- So suppose we have 3 elements, then our * is going to take the value of 12/3 ie 4.
- Suppose if we are aiming for very small screens ie for mobiles, then we use `col-xs-*`.

# Text

- We can use `text-primary` class in order to beautify heading and texts in our web page.
- Use `text-danger` class in order to signify any dangerous text :)
