```php
$variable1 = "Sam";

```

- Assignment Operators
- Comparision Operators
- Increment/ Decrement Operators
- Logical Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

<hr>

- To add `variable1` with `variable2`, simply write `variable1+variable2`.
- To subtract `variable1` from `variable2`, we do `variable2-variable1`.
- In order to multiply, we use `*` sign.
- In order to divide, we use `/` sign.
