# CPU

<hr>

- **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit

<hr>

# RAM

<hr>

- Random Access Memory
- Generally lost when power cycled

<hr>

# VRAM

<hr>

- Video RAM
- This is for screen size and color depth

<hr>

# ROM

<hr>

- Read Only Memory
- Used for boot

<hr>

# IO Input/ Output

<hr>

- IO is through interfaces such as SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

<hr>

# USB

<hr>

- Universal Serial Bus

<hr>

# HD

<hr>

- Hard Disk
- For permanent storage

<hr>

# CDROM

<hr>

- Compact Disk Read Only Memory

<hr>

# Operating Systems

<hr>

- Controls everything in the way the computer works.
- Not specific to a CPU type, but often some OS's are associated with specific CPU

<hr>

- Windows
- Mac OS
- Fedora Unix
- Android
- Ubuntu
- Raspberry Pi OS

<hr>

- OS controls IO and memory management (latter is important in multi tasking OS)
- Specific program's implementations are often dependent on OS

<hr>

# Hard Disk

<hr>

- Contains the computer's file system
- A **file system** defines how files are named, stored, and retrieved from a storage device.
- **NFC**: Network File System allows connections between different computer systems.

<hr>

- Smallest thing in a computer is called **bit**
- CPU basically only performs how to perform **AND**, **OR** and **XOR**(exclusive or).
- CPU is a massive collection of **AND** and **OR** gates.
- CPU's only understand *Machine Language*
- Every addition, multiplication, subtraction.... happens only through AND, OR and XOR operations.

<hr>

# Clock Speed

<hr>

- The number of instructions per second is set by the clock speed
- One clock tick is called a cycle and modern CPU's can often execute more than one instruction per cycle
- Floating point speed is measured in "floating point operations per seconds" flops. ‚≠ê

<hr>

- To manage things, bits are grouped into larger units.
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- 2/ 4/ 8 bytes = word (varies between CPU)
- Most desktop machines are 32 bit word, but 64 bits machines are becoming more common (set by data bus)
