<hr>

### Procedural Language

<hr>

- Specifies a series of well structured steps and procedures to compose a program.
- Contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task.

<hr>

### Functional Language

<hr>

- Writing a program only in pure functions ie, never modify variables but only create new ones as an output.
- Used in situation where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ML
- First class functions?

<hr>

### Object Oriented

<hr>

- Revolves around objects.
- Code + Data = Object
- Developed to make it easier to develop, debug and maintain software.

<h2 align="center">Static Vs Dynamic Languages</h2>

### Static Languages

<hr>

- Performs type checking at the compile time.
- Errors will show at compile time.
- Declare datatype before you use it.
- More control

<hr>

### Dynamic Languages

<hr>

- Performs type checking at runtime.
- Error might not show till program start running.
- No need to declare datatype of variables.
- Saves time in writing code.
