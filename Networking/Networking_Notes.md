<hr>

* The collection of interconnected computers is called computer network.
* Two computers are said to be connected if they are capable of sharing and exchanging information or resources.

<hr>

## Advantages

* Resource Sharing
* Reliability
* Cost Effectiveness
* Communication Medium

<hr>

## Elaborating Every Advantage

<hr>

### Resource Sharing

<hr>

Resource sharing means to make all programs, data and peripherals available to anyone on the network irrespective of physical location of the resources and the user.

<hr>

### Advantages

<hr>

Reliability means to keep the copy of a file on two or more diffrent machines , so if one of them is unavailable ,then its other copy can be used.

<hr>

### Cost Factor

<hr>

Cost factor means it greatly reduces the cost since the resources can be shared.

<hr>

### Communication Medium

<hr>

Communication medium one can send messages and whatever the changes at one one end which can be immediately noticed at another end.

<hr>

![](https://www.electronicsmedia.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/type-switching.jpg)

<hr>

### Circuit Switching

<hr>

* In the circuit switching technique , firstly a **complete end to end transmission path between the source and the destination computer is established** and **then message is transmitted through the path**.
* The main advantage of this technique is **guaranteed delivery of the message**. Mostly used for voice communication.

<hr>

<hr>

### Packet Switching

<hr>

* In this technique **fixed size of packets** can be transmitted across network.

<hr>

![](PacketSwitching.png)

<hr>

### Message Switching

<hr>

* In message switching technique , **no physical path is established between sender and receiver in advance**.
* Thus each node receives the entire message , stores it entirely in disk , and transmits the message to the next node if it is not the destination node.
* This type of network is also called  **Store -and-forward** network.

## Data Communication Technologies

* Channel
* Bandwidth
* Data Transfer Rate

<hr>

### Channel

<hr>

* Channel is the medium used to carry information or data from one point to another.
* Physical medium like cables over which the information is exchanged is called **channel**.

<hr>

### Bandwidth

<hr>

* Data transfer rates that can be supported by a network is called its bandwidth.
* Bandwidth is directly proportional to the amount of data transmitted or received per unit time.
* Example ,it takes more bandwidth to download an image file in 1 sec than to download a page of text in 1 sec.
* Large sound files , vedios , animated mivies requires more bandwidth.
* High bandwidth channels are called **broadband channels**.
* Low bandwidth channels are called **narrowband channels**.
* Bandwidth refers tot the diffrence between highest and lowest frequencies of a transmission channel.
* It is the range of frequencies contained in a composite signal or the range of frequencies a channel can pass.
* It is measured as:
> * Hz
> * KHz
> * MHz

<hr>

### Data Transfer Rate

<hr>

* It identifies the number of data elements (bits) sent in 1 sec.
* The data transfer rate represents the amount of data transferred per second by a communication channel or a computing or a storage device.
* Data Transfer rate is measured in units of bits per seconds (bps) , Bps(Bytes per second)
* When applied to data rate , the multiplexer prefixer: 'kilo' , 'mega' , 'tera' etc..
* Kbps
* Gbps
* Tbps

<hr>

## Transmission Media

* Transmission media is the medium over the messages are transmitted.
