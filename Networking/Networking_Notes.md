* The collection of interconnected computers is called computer network.
* Two computers are said to be connected if they are capable of sharing and exchanging information or resources.

<hr>

## Advantages

* Resource Sharing
* Reliability
* Cost Effectiveness
* Communication Medium

<hr>

## Elaborating Every Advantage

<hr>

### Resource Sharing

<hr>

Resource sharing means to make all programs, data and peripherals available to anyone on the network irrespective of physical location of the resources and the user.

<hr>

### Advantages

<hr>

Reliability means to keep the copy of a file on two or more diffrent machines , so if one of them is unavailable ,then its other copy can be used.

<hr>

### Cost Factor

<hr>

Cost factor means it greatly reduces the cost since the resources can be shared.

<hr>

### Communication Medium

<hr>

Communication medium one can send messages and whatever the changes at one one end which can be immediately noticed at another end.

<hr>

* TCP is a **connection-oriented protocol** that is first the connection is established between the sender and the receiver.
* TCP divides the large packets to to transmit into smaller data packets called **Datagrams**.
* At the receiving end , it also reassemble the packet from original message.

<hr>

* IP is responsible for moving packet of data from node to node. IP forwards each packet based on a four byte destination address(the IP number) .The Internet authorities assign ranges of numbers to different organisations .The organisations assign groups of their numbers to departments.

## Network Topologies

<hr>

* Topology is an **art of connecting diffrent computers in a network.**
* The way in which the computers / devices are physically interconnected to form a network is called a **Topology**.

<hr>

## Types Of Topology

<hr>

* Ring Topology
* Bus Topology
* Star Topology
* Tree Topology

<hr>

### Bus Topology

<hr>

![](http://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap5/pics/linebus.gif)

<hr>

* In a bus topology , **all the nodes are connected to a main cable called backbone.
* If any node has to send some information to any other node , it **sends the signal to the backbone**.
* The signal travels through the entire length of the backbone and is received by the node for which it is intended.

<hr>

#### Advantages

<hr>

* It is easy to install
* It requires less cable length and hence , it is cost effective.
* Failure of a node does not affect the network.

<hr>

#### Disadvantages

<hr>

* In case of a cable fault , the entire network goes down.
* At a time , only one node can transmit data.

<hr>

### Star Topology

<hr>

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128024379000059-f05-17-9780128024379.jpg)

<hr>

* In a Star topology , **each node is directly connected to a hub / switch**.
* I any node has to send any information to any other node , it sends the signal to the hub/switch.
* The star topology uses a separate cable for each node / workstation. The cable connects the node to a central device typically a HUB.

<hr>

#### Advantages

<hr>

* It is easy to install.
* It is easy to diagnose the fault in Star Topology.
* If one link fails , the network can still function.

<hr>

#### Disadvantages

<hr>

* Failure of Hub / Switch leads to failure of entire network.
* It requires more cable length as compared to Bus Topology.

<hr>

### Ring Topology

<hr>

<hr>

* In a ring topology , **every computer is connected to the next computer in the ring and each transmit the signal , what it receives from the previous computer**. The messages flow around the ring in one direction.

<hr>

#### Advantages

<hr>

* Easy to install and configure.
* Easy to detect the problem.
* All the data flows in one direction , reducing the chance of the packet collission.

<hr>

#### Disadvantages

<hr>

* All the data being transferref over the network must pass through each workstation on the network , which can make it slower than a star topology.
* The entire network will be impacted if one workstation shuts down.

<hr>

### Tree Topology

<hr>

![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tWrHkpypIuU/TwQ-RTFK5bI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/LbYrLp3ngdM/s1600/tree_topology_Diagram.JPG)
