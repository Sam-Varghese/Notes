# Statistics Notes

* Statistics is the art of learning from data. It is concerned with the collection of data, their subsequent description, and their analysis which often leads to drawing of conclusions.

## Major Branches of Statistics

### Description

* The part of statistics concerned with the description and summarization of data is called **Descriptive Statistics**.

### Inference

* Part of statistics concerned with the drawing of conclusions from the data is called **Inferential Statistics**

## Population

* The total collection of all elements that we are intrsted in is called a population.

## Sample

* A subgroup of the population that will be studied in detail is called sample.

* A descriptive study may be performed either on a sample or on a population.
* When inference is made about population based on information from sample, the study becomes **inferential**.

## Data

* Data are facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation.

* **Each variable have its own column**
* **Each observation have its own row**

***Data are of two types, Categorical and numerical***

## Categorical Variables

* Also called **Qualitative variables**
* Identifies group membership.

## Numerical Variables

* Also called **Quantitative variables**
* Describes numerical properties of cases.
* Have measurement units.

## Time Series

* Data recorded over time

## Timeplot

* Graph of time series showing values in chronological order.

## Cross-Sectional

* Data observed at the same time.

## Scales Of Measurement

* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Interval
* Ratio

## Nominal Scale Of Measurement

* When the data for a variable consists of names or labels used to identify the characteristics of an observation, the scale of measurement is called **Nominal Scale**.
* The main characteristic feature of this scale is that no ordering happens.
* Variables can even be numerically coded like male as 0 and female as 1 or vice-versa and here also we can see that 0<1 is meaningless.
