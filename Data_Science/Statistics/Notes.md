# Statistics Notes

* Statistics is the art of learning from data. It is concerned with the collection of data, their subsequent description, and their analysis which often leads to drawing of conclusions.

## Major Branches of Statistics

### Description

* The part of statistics concerned with the description and summarization of data is called **Descriptive Statistics**.

### Inference

* Part of statistics concerned with the drawing of conclusions from the data is called **Inferential Statistics**

## Population

* The total collection of all elements that we are intrsted in is called a population.

## Sample

* A subgroup of the population that will be studied in detail is called sample.

* A descriptive study may be performed either on a sample or on a population.
* When inference is made about population based on information from sample, the study becomes **inferential**.

## Data

* Data are facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation.

* **Each variable have its own column**
* **Each observation have its own row**

***Data are of two types, Categorical and numerical***

## Categorical Variables

* Also called **Qualitative variables**
* Identifies group membership.

## Numerical Variables

* Also called **Quantitative variables**
* Describes numerical properties of cases.
* Have measurement units.

## Time Series

* Data recorded over time

## Timeplot

* Graph of time series showing values in chronological order.

## Cross-Sectional

* Data observed at the same time.

## Scales Of Measurement

* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Interval
* Ratio

## Nominal Scale Of Measurement

* When the data for a variable consists of names or labels used to identify the characteristics of an observation, the scale of measurement is called **Nominal Scale**.
* The main characteristic feature of this scale is that no ordering happens.
* Variables can even be numerically coded like male as 0 and female as 1 or vice-versa and here also we can see that 0<1 is meaningless.

## Ordinal Scale Of Measurement

* This is simply nominal scale of measurement with an added feature that the data can be ordered or ranked meaningfully.
* Ex, Remarks which can include bad<good<excellent<extraordinary

## Interval Scale Of Measurement

* This scale of measurement just consist of ordinal scale with an added feature that the intervals between values can be expressed in terms of fixed unit of measure.
* Ratios have no meaning here because value of zero is arbitrary.
* As values of zero is arbitrary, hence ratios also have no meaning.
* Ex: Consider an AC room where temperature is set at 20deg C and the temperature outside the room is 40deg C. So it would be right to say that diffrence between both is 20deg C, but it is very incorrect to say that outdoors is twice as hot as indoors because we dont know which temperature signifies absolute absence of heat.

## Ratio Scale Of Measurement

* If the data have all the properties of interval data, and the ratio of two values is meaningful, then the scale of measurement is ratio scale.
* Here the knowledge of absolute zero numerical value is known.
* Ex height, weight, age, marks, etc
* All operations like addittion, subtraction, multiplication, division are possible.

## Relative Frequency

* Number of cases/Total number of observation taken

## Pareto Charts

* These are simply bar charts sorted by frequency.
* If categorical variable is ordinal, the bar chart must preserve th ordering.

# Valid Charts Rule

## Area Principle

* **The area occupied by a part of graph should correspond to the amount of data it represents.**
* Hence for a valid bar chart,  all the bars should be of same width.

## Truncated Graphs

* Valid graphs always starts from 0 of y axis, so as to give full information.

## Rounding Off

* As for a valid graph, rounding off is done very carefully. Because if rounding off is done in pie charts uncarefully, then all percentages when added up can add up to more than 100%.

## Mode

* The mode of a categorical variable is the most common category, the category with the highest frequency.

## Bimodal Data

* If two or more categories tie for the highest frequency, the data are said to be **bimodal** (in case of two) or **multimodal** (more than two).

## Median

* ***Firstly put all records in order***.

![Median](Median.PNG)

* If two values come in between, then any of them can become median.

## Organizing Discrete Data (Single Value)

* If the data set contains only a small number of distinct, or diffrent values, it is convenient to represent it in a **frequency table**.

## Organizing Continous Data

* Best method of organizing continous data is to split them into diffrent classes. However there are few points that needs to be kept in mind while making classes:

1. **Number of classes**: The appropiate number is subjective choice, the rule of thumb is to have 5 to 20 classes.
2. Each observation must belong to some class and no observation should belong to more than one class.
3. It is common, although not essential to choose class intervals of equal length.

## Some New Terms

1. **Lower Class Limit**: The smallest value that could go in a class.
2. **Upper Class Limit**: The larget value that could go in a class.
3. **Class Width**: The diffrence between lower limit of a class and the lower limit of the next higher class.
4. **Class Mark**: he avaerage of two class limits of a class.
