- Made by **Bjarne Stroustrup**
- 1979
- AT & T's Bell Labs
- Also called **C with classes**.
- 1983
- C++ is a middle level language.
- C++ joins three separate programming traditions

* **Procedural Language** tradition represented by C
* The **Object Oriented** language tradition represented by class enhancements C++ adds to C;
* **Generic Programming** supported by C++ templates.

## DIffrence Between C and C++

- C++ is the super set of C language.
- C++ programs can use existing C software libraries.
- C follows top down approach of programming.
- C++ follows bottom up approach of programming.
- C adopts Procedural Oriented Programming
- C++ adopts Object Oriented Programming

<hr>

## Object Oriented Programming

- OOPs is a programming approach which revolves around the concept of Object.
- Any entity in the system that can be defined as a set of properties and set of operations performed using entity's property set, is known as Object.

<hr>

## Concept Of Classes And Objects

- Class is a blueprint of an Object
- Class is a description of Object's property set and set of operations.
- Creating Class is as good as defining a new data type.
- Class is a means to achieve encapsulation.
- Object is a run time entity.
- Object is an instance of a class.

## Types Of Constants

<hr>

### Primary Constants

<hr>

- Integer
- Real
- Character

<hr>

### Secondary Constants

<hr>

- Array
- String
- Pointer
- Union
- Structure
- Enumerator
- Class

<hr>

#### Integer Constant

<hr>

23, -341, 0, 5

<hr>

#### Real Constant

<hr>

3.4, **3.0**

<hr>

#### Character Constant

<hr>

* Length should be 1
* Should be enclosed with only single quotes.
* 'a', 'A', '+'

<hr>

#### Strings

<hr>

* Enclosed by double quotes.
* Can have any length.
* Ex "Sam Varghese"

<hr>

## Variables

<hr>

* Variables are the names of memory locations where we store data.
* Variable name is any combination of alphabet (a to z or A to Z), digit (0 to 9) and underscore(_).
* Variables in C++ can start with only **alphabets, underscores**.

## Data Types

<hr>

* int  {int a, b=5;}
* char {char ch='a';}
* float {float k=3.45;}
* double {double d1;}

<hr>

* int takes 2 bytes
* char takes 1 byte
* float takes 4 bytes
* double takes 8 bytes

<hr>

## Declare Variable Anywhere

<hr>

* Unlike C, you can declare variables even after action statements.
* Ex

```c
{
    cirscr();
    int x=4;
}
```
